Initial code examination and problem discovery using static analysis tools like CppCheck and Visual Studio's IntelliSense marked the start of the debugging process. A number of issues were found during the analysis, including an infinite recursion in the TypeChecker::isType method, an exception thrown in a method marked noexcept (SpecialType::safeMethod), a possible issue with a dangling pointer in the incorrectPointerAssignment function, an incorrect modification of a vector during iteration in the vectorModificationTest function, and incorrect boolean return and assignment operations.

refactored the code to fix these problems, starting with renaming classes and functions to increase purpose and clarity. TypeChecker::isType's infinite loop was stopped by changing the logic to return false in the event that a type could not be located. To comply with the noexcept standard, we eliminated the throw statement from SpecialType::safeMethod. In incorrectPointerAssignment, the local variable b was set to static in order to avoid a dangling pointer problem.

In addition, the workWithArrays method now includes bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds array access. Using the erase-remove idiom, the vector modification logic in vectorModificationTest was fixed, guaranteeing safe iteration and modification. In order to properly handle boolean operations, we also corrected the boolean logic in calculateFunction and the assertions in main. Additionally, by making sure the loop advanced properly, the endless loop in processToken was fixed.
